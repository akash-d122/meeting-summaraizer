# Task ID: 13
# Title: Apply Security Best Practices and Input Validation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement security measures for API endpoints, file uploads, and user inputs.
# Details:
Validate all inputs (file types, email addresses, text fields). Sanitize user data to prevent injection attacks. Secure API keys using environment variables. Enforce rate limiting on sensitive endpoints.

# Test Strategy:
Run security tests for injection, invalid files, and rate limiting. Attempt to access protected resources without authorization.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Rate Limiting and API Protection [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add rate limiting to prevent abuse and protect API endpoints from excessive requests
### Details:

## 2. Input Validation and Sanitization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization for all user inputs
### Details:
- Validate file types and sizes on upload\n- Sanitize email addresses and custom instructions\n- Implement SQL injection prevention\n- Add XSS protection for text inputs\n- Validate API request parameters\n- Implement content security policy headers\n- Add input length limits and format validation

## 3. File Upload Security Hardening [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Secure file upload functionality against malicious files and attacks
### Details:
- Implement file type validation using magic numbers\n- Add file size limits and virus scanning\n- Secure file storage with proper permissions\n- Prevent directory traversal attacks\n- Implement file content scanning\n- Add file quarantine for suspicious uploads\n- Secure temporary file handling
