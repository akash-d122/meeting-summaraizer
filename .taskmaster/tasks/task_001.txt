# Task ID: 1
# Title: Initialize Project Repository and Environment
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the project repository, initialize version control, and configure the development environment with required dependencies and environment variables.
# Details:
Create a new Git repository. Set up .gitignore for node_modules, environment files, and build artifacts. Initialize Node.js/Express.js backend and React.js frontend (or basic HTML/CSS/JS if React is not chosen). Configure environment variables for API keys (Groq, email service). Document setup steps in README.

# Test Strategy:
Verify repository can be cloned and project dependencies installed. Ensure environment variables are loaded correctly and project starts without errors.
